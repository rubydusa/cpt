# CPT - Circom Prolog Transpiler

The Circom Prolog Transpiler enables easy generation of circom templates by utilizing integer constraint libraries.
Users are able to write constraints in a declerative way and the transpiler will convert it to a circom template.

Note that not all configurations of constraints can be translated into arithmetic circuits.

Features:
- [ ] Core Features
- [ ] Partial Support for equations with division
- [ ] Attempt to factor polynomial constraints into intermediate signals
- [ ] Inequality constraints
- [ ] Range constraints
- [ ] Use of custom templates within generated template

CORE FEATURES ARE WORK IN PROGRESS
